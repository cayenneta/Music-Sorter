# Music Sorter
 ### My finished music sorter! The history and changes are in my python repo :)
 
 My friends kept telling me to have my music in folders even though having every file in one directory and having my music player sort with metadata had been working fine, but I decided to write this and use dictionaries to learn how to use those
 
 This requires the Tiny Tag library to run https://pypi.org/project/tinytag/ you can easily install it with ```pip3 install tinytag```.
 
 Just run with ```python3 main.py```, type in the absolute path to your music directory, and then whether or not you want to ignore files in folders and subfolders. The program creates folders of every artist it finds, and subfolders of albums, where it puts the files. I tried this on Python 3.10.12, idk if it works on older versions, sorry!
 
## I have only tried this on Linux Mint, if you're on Windows try at your own risk, I am not responsible for your data being lost!
